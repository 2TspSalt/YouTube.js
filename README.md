# YouTube.js

A wrapper around the Innertube API, which is what YouTube itself uses. This makes YouTube.js fast, simple & efficient.

#### What can it do?

Well currently this library is able to: search, get detailed info about videos, subscribe/unsubscribe/like/dislike/comment (Cookies required) and download videos. 

#### Do I need an API key to use this?

No, since it's basically what YouTube itself uses to populate its app/website no API keys are required.
